## Description

- Installed Auth0 v5 as a dependency
  *** Several "critical" vulnerabilities! ***
  * Recommend upgrading to latest version of React & Auth0 v6
- Wrapped "App" component in Auth0Provider allowing auth to be used throughout the app as needed
- Created dummy username and password for testing & added it to ReadMe
- Added "Log In" / "Profile" / "Log Out" / "Sign Up" buttons to display conditionally on header
- Created profile page with prompts to log in or sign up if not authenticated
