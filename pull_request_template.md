## Description

GraphWrapper file changed to integrate app with API. Some functions require future changes in other files (such as choosing which years to display). These features are currently commented out.

Removed unnecessarily repeated code in: 
  - function 'handleOfficeSelect' in GraphContainer; and,
  - 'initialState' object in vizReducer;
